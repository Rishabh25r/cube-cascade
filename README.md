Cube Cascade is a dynamic web game where players input details and choose a target score. Rolling virtual dice, matching numbers boosts the score; differing ones forfeit turns. Animated dice rolls and vibrant background videos enhance the immersive experience. The goal is to persistently roll until the score surpasses or equals the set target.
